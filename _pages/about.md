I am a doctoral candidate at the Chair of Political Science & International Politics of Prof. Dirk Leuffen. My research interests include decision-making and interinstitutional relations in the European Union, legislative studies and European integration. I predominantly employ quantitative methods and Natural Language Processing.
I am grateful to receive a doctoral scholarship through the state graduate funding of Baden-Württemberg and the University of Konstanz (LGFG scholarship). In my dissertation, I investigate the European Parliament’s ability to fulfil crucial parliamentary tasks such as proposing new legislation, scrutinising the executive, and representing citizens. My research is grounded in the broader literature on legislative assemblies to contribute to a better understanding of EU decision-making and legislative dynamics.
I hold a master’s degree in Politics and Public Administration, specialising in International Relations and European Integration, from the University of Konstanz. Prior to my master’s, I completed my bachelor’s degree in Politics and Public Administration at the University of Konstanz. In addition, I studied abroad at the University of York (UK) and KU Leuven (Belgium).
